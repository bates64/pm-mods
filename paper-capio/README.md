# Paper Capio

This is an example asset replacement mod. Specifically, it changes the title screen logotype to say "Paper Capio" instead of "Paper Mario". This is inspired by Ethan's [joke video](ethteck-video).

In future, this mod could be expanded to change the player sprite, but [decomp doesn't support that yet](player-sprites-issue).
